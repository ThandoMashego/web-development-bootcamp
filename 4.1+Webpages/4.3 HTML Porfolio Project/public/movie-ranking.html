<hr />

<h3>The hypnotic</h3>

<p>
this movie is amazing, the twist of it at the end is absolutely great.
So in the beginning we're introduced to a therapsit that can help people get over addictions, fears and ptsd.
Without letting them know that hes actually hyponotising them.
At the end this women that she helped get over her fear in spiders 
died from a heart attack and it was so confusing for people, because she was young.
WHat he actually did, the therapsit was hypotise her to forget,
spiders but at a click of a snap they would appear on her body and thats waht killed her.

<h3>Invisble man </h3>

<p>
This is about a billionaire tech guywho is obsessive over his girl friend and when they 
they break-up he goes ahead and build aa suit that makes him invisible. 
He then continues to abuse her and tortue and let people think she has gone mad.

<h3>Venom</h3>
<p>
This movie is about a man that gets infused with an alien and they both play a good role in saving the world from 
being abducted by other evil aliens that eat heads.
